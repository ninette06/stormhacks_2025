<p>The 30% rule is a widely recommended guideline that suggests you should spend no more than 30% of your gross monthly income on housing costs (rent or mortgage payments).</p>

<h4>Why this matters:</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Financial Stability</strong>: Keeps housing affordable relative to your income</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Fund</strong>: Leaves room for savings and unexpected expenses</li>
<li><strong>Other Expenses</strong>: Ensures you can cover food, transportation, healthcare, and other necessities</li>
<li><strong>Debt Management</strong>: Prevents overextending yourself financially</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example:</h4>

<p>If you earn $3,000/month, your housing costs should be $900 or less.</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> This includes rent/mortgage, utilities, insurance, and property taxes. Some experts suggest 25% for even better financial health!</p>"""

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate - it's the yearly cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage.

**What APR includes:**
‚Ä¢ Interest rate on the loan
‚Ä¢ Fees and charges
‚Ä¢ Other costs associated with the loan

**Why APR matters:**
‚Ä¢ **True Cost**: Shows the real cost of borrowing, not just the interest rate
‚Ä¢ **Comparison Tool**: Helps you compare different loan offers
‚Ä¢ **Budget Planning**: Helps you understand your monthly payments

**Example**: A credit card with 18% APR means you'll pay $18 in interest for every $100 you borrow for a full year.

**Pro tip**: Lower APR = less money you pay back. Always shop around for the best APR!"""

**What are stocks?**
Stocks represent ownership shares in a company. When you buy stock, you become a partial owner.

**Key Concepts:**
‚Ä¢ **Risk vs Return**: Higher potential returns usually come with higher risk

‚Ä¢ **Diversification**: Don't put all your money in one stock - spread it across different companies and sectors

‚Ä¢ **Long-term Thinking**: Stock prices fluctuate daily, but historically, markets tend to rise over time

‚Ä¢ **Research**: Always research companies before investing

**Why diversification matters:**
‚Ä¢ Reduces risk by spreading investments across different assets

‚Ä¢ If one stock performs poorly, others may perform well

‚Ä¢ Helps protect your portfolio from major losses

**Pro tip**: Start with index funds or ETFs for instant diversification, then consider individual stocks as you learn more!"""

‚Ä¢ **Budgeting**: Track income and expenses to live within your means
‚Ä¢ **Saving**: Build an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses)
‚Ä¢ **Investing**: Make your money work for you over time
‚Ä¢ **Debt Management**: Understand good vs bad debt
‚Ä¢ **Credit**: Build and maintain good credit scores

**The 50/30/20 Rule:**
‚Ä¢ 50% for needs (housing, food, utilities)
‚Ä¢ 30% for wants (entertainment, dining out)
‚Ä¢ 20% for savings and debt repayment

**Emergency Fund Priority:**
Before investing, build an emergency fund. This protects you from unexpected expenses without going into debt.
